<h2>Champignons Farcis</h2>
<p>This recipe comes from volume one of Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child,</p>
<p>Louisette Bertholle, and Simone Beck. I did use the listed ingredients. However,</p> 
<p>I precooked the mushroom caps, which was not a part of the original instructions.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>12 fresh mushroom caps 2 to 3 inches in diameter, stems removed (but reserved)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons minced green onions</li>
    <li>Stems from the mushroom caps, finely minced and squeezed in a towel to extract their juice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Madeira (optional)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons finely minced onions</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons minced parsley</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Swiss Cheese (plus 2 extra tablespoons for topping)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 to 3 tablespoons whipping cream</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Saute the cleaned and stemmed mushroom caps in 1 tablespoon of oil for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Place them cap side up on paper towels to drain off excess liquid and set aside.</p></li>
    <li><p>Saute the minced onions in 1 tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons of butter for 3 to 4</p> <p>minutes without browning. Then add the green onions and mushroom stems. Saute over</p> <p>moderately high heat for 6 minutes until lightly browned.</p></li>
    <li><p>If using the optional Madeira as we did, add it now along with salt and pepper. Boil</p> <p>it down rapidly until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated.</p></li>
    <li>Off heat, mix in the bread crumbs, parsley, tarragon, and cheeses.</li>
    <li><p>Add the whipping cream 1 tablespoon at a time, just enough to moisten the mixture,</p> <p>but keeping it intact enough to hold its shape in a spoon. Correct the seasoning, if</p> <p>needed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fill the mushroom caps with the stuffing, topping each with a pinch of Swiss cheese</p> <p>and a few drops of melted butter.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bake in the upper third of a preheated 375Â°F oven for 15 minutes. The stuffing should</p> <p>be lightly browned on top.</p></li>
</ol>
