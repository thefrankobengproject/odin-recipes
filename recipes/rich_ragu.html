<h2>Rich ragu</h2>
<p>A rich, versatile meat sauce: serve it Bolognese-fashion with spaghetti or use it as a base for lasagne or moussaka</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, halved and finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 celery stick, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, finely diced</li>
    <li>600g % minced red meat steak</li>
    <li>three tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
    <li>2 tsp sparkling thyme leaves</li>
    <li>150ml crimson wine (or use more red meat stock)</li>
    <li>500ml beef stock</li>
    <li>400g spaghetti</li>
    <li>50g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
    <li>side salad, to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onion, celery and carrot. Fry over a medium heat for 10 mins, stirring frequently, till</p> 
        <p>softened and the colour of the vegetables starting to shade.</p></li>
    <li>Stir in the mince and cook, breaking apart any clumps of meat with a wood spoon, until browned.</li>
    <li><p>Add the tomato purée, garlic and thyme, and cook dinner for 1-2 minutes more. Pour in the wine, if the use of the wine</p> 
        <p>increases the heat to boil off maximum of the alcohol. Reduce the heat, stir inside the stock and season. Cover with a tight-fitting</p> 
        <p>lid and leave to cook gently for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins till the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.</p></li>
    <li><p>Remove the lid and continue cooking for 15 mins. Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions. Reserve a mugful of the</p> 
        <p>cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and add to the ragu with the Parmesan. Toss well and add a bit pasta water to assist the sauce</p> 
        <p>coat the spaghetti. Serve with a side salad and extra cheese, if you like.</p></li>
