<h2>Braciole</h2>
<p>Many ingredients can comprise these delectable stuffed beef rolls (braciole). Cooks also</p> 
<p>substitute other proteins for beef,</p> 
<p>such as chicken, pork, or fish, and the stuffing mixture can also vary widely. Many</p> 
<p>recipes call for making individual stuffed</p>
<p>beef rolls to serve each person.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For the beef rolls (braciole) and stuffing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>12 thin slices (1/8 to 1/4 inch slice) top round, Milanesa cut</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds ground veal</li>
<li>1/3 pound salami, finely chopped or minced</li>
<li>1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature</li>
<li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
<li>6 slices rustic Italian bread, or enough to make 1 cup of breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Italian parsley, minced</li>
<li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, or as much needed to brown the beef rolls on all sides</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the sauce:</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 1/2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>3 medium carrots, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
<li>2 (28-ounce) cans petite diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>If you cannot find already cut Milanesa-style slices of beef, flatten slices of top round</p>
    <p>by pounding as thin as possible. Ideally, it should be 1/8th to 1/4-inch thick. Set aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a food processor to make breadcrumbs from the rustic Italian bread and put them into</p>
    <p>a bowl with the milk. When moistened, add the breadcrumbs by batches into a cheesecloth,</p>
    <p>and squeeze out the excess milk.</p></li>
<li>Add the salami to the food processor and run until it is finely minced.</li>
<li><p>Combine the ground veal, salami, Parmesan cheese, softened butter, beaten eggs, moistened</p>
    <p>breadcrumbs, minced parsley, salt, and pepper into a mixing bowl. Combine until well-mixed.</p> 
    <p>(Tip: To test for the correct amount of seasoning, take a small amount of the stuffing mixture</p> 
    <p>and fry it in a small pan. Taste it. If more salt or pepper is needed, add it to the raw</p> 
    <p>stuffing mixture before proceeding).</p></li>
<li><p>Lay one slice of the top round on a flat surface. Put a large helping of stuffing mixture</p> 
    <p>in the center and turn up the sides and ends. If needed, add another cut piece of meat to</p> 
    <p>fit the exposed top. Tightly tie each roll with about 3 or 4 pieces of kitchen string</p> 
    <p>trimming the edges. Keep repeating this process until using all of the meat and stuffing.</p></li>
<li>In a large kettle with olive oil, saute each beef roll until brown on all sides and set aside.</li>
<li><p>Using the same kettle for browning the braciole, heat the oil and butter. Add the onions,</p> 
    <p>carrots, and garlic, sauteing until softened.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the bay leaves, and stir in the white wine. Cook over moderate heat until most of the</p> 
    <p>liquid has evaporated.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, add the canned tomatoes and bring to a boil. Add the beef rolls and reduce the</p> 
    <p>heat to a simmer. Cook the combination for at least 1 hour or until the beef is fork-tender.</li>
<li>Remove the braciole and reduce the sauce to desired consistency.</li>
<li><p>Refrigerate the braciole and sauce separately overnight. Skim the fat from the surface of</p> 
    <p>the sauce. The sauce may remain in this rustic stage, or if desired, be made smoother by</p>
    <p>using an immersion blender.</p></li>
<li><p>Slice the braciola on the bias about 1/2-inch thick after removing the strings. (It cuts more</p> 
    <p>easily when cooled overnight in the refrigerator.)</p></li>
<li><p>To heat, put the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish and top with the slices of braciole.</p> 
    <p>Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until thoroughly heated.</p></li>
<li><p>For presentation purposes, put some sauce on the bottom of a plate and top with one or more</p>
    <p>slices of the braciole. Garnish with additional chopped parsley and other accompaniments.</p></li>
</ol>
